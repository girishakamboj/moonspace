    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>At Moonspace, we are committed to creating a safe and confidential environment for anyone seeking counselling or therapy through our services. Protecting your personal information is central to the trust that underlies every therapeutic relationship. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information while ensuring that your rights are respected throughout the process.</p>

    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
    <p>We only collect information that is necessary to provide high-quality online counselling services. This may include your name, email address, and contact information to facilitate bookings and communications. We may also maintain session notes to support continuity of care and to reflect upon the therapeutic process. Additionally, technical information, such as IP address or browser type, may be used for security purposes or to improve the functionality of our services. Payment information is processed securely by trusted third-party platforms and is never stored in a manner that would compromise your privacy.</p>

    <h3>Use of Information</h3>
    <p>Your personal information is used exclusively to provide and enhance our counselling services. This includes scheduling and managing sessions, communicating essential updates, and maintaining a safe and professional environment. Information may also be used to ensure that the services you receive are tailored to your needs, while remaining confidential and respectful of your privacy.</p>

    <h3>Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We do not sell or share personal information for marketing purposes. Limited sharing may occur with service providers who facilitate booking, payment, or communication, and only for the purposes necessary to deliver the services. Information may also be disclosed if required by law, for example in situations where there is a risk of harm to yourself or others. In every case, we ensure that only the minimum necessary information is shared and that confidentiality is upheld wherever possible.</p>

    <h3>Data Retention and Security</h3>
    <p>All personal and session-related information is stored securely and is accessible only to authorized personnel. We implement measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, or misuse. The data is retained only as long as necessary to provide therapeutic services and to comply with professional and legal obligations.</p>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal data. You may also set limits on the use of your information or withdraw consent if desired, without affecting your ability to engage in therapy. We encourage open communication regarding privacy concerns, and you are welcome to discuss the handling of your data with your therapist at any point.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>Therapy involves sharing sensitive and personal experiences. We handle all information with care, adhering to ethical principles of respect, autonomy, and non-maleficence. Your participation in therapy is voluntary, and you are encouraged to raise any questions about confidentiality or data use. Our practices aim to ensure that your privacy is protected while supporting a meaningful therapeutic experience.</p>
