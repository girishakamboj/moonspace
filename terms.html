    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Moonspace. By engaging with our online counselling services, including scheduling and attending sessions, you acknowledge and accept the terms outlined here. Our aim is to provide a professional, ethical, and supportive environment that promotes emotional wellbeing and personal growth.</p>

    <h3>Scope of Services</h3>
    <p>The services provided are intended for mental and emotional support and do not constitute medical diagnosis or treatment. While therapy can facilitate understanding and personal insight, it should not be considered a replacement for urgent medical care. Individuals experiencing crises are encouraged to seek immediate professional help from appropriate healthcare providers.</p>

    <h3>Consent and Voluntary Participation</h3>
    <p>Participation in therapy is entirely voluntary. Booking a session indicates your informed consent to engage in online counselling and to the collection and use of necessary personal information as described in our Privacy Policy. Clients are encouraged to communicate openly about their boundaries and preferences regarding the use of their information or the course of therapy.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>All interactions are treated with strict confidentiality in line with professional ethical standards. Exceptions to confidentiality are limited to circumstances where there is a risk of harm to self or others, situations involving abuse, or legal obligations. Even in these instances, only information essential for addressing the concern is disclosed.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling and Payments</h3>
    <p>Sessions are scheduled through secure platforms and require advance booking. Payments are processed through trusted third-party providers. Clients are responsible for ensuring a safe and private environment during sessions. Moonspace and its therapists are not liable for outcomes resulting from technical issues or connectivity interruptions.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Principles and Therapeutic Approach</h3>
    <p>Our approach emphasizes respect for client autonomy, collaborative engagement, and professional ethical standards. Therapy aims to support insight, emotional regulation, and gradual personal growth, always allowing clients to progress at their own pace and in a manner that feels safe and comfortable.</p>

    <p>All content on the Moonspace website, including text, graphics, and design elements, is the property of Moonspace and may not be reproduced without express permission.</p>
