    <h1>A quieter place to meet yourself</h1>
    <p>
      Moonspace is an online counselling practice for people who feel mentally
      tired, emotionally overwhelmed, or unsure where to begin. It offers a
      calm and steady space to talk, reflect, and slowly understand what is
      happening within you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therapy here is not rushed. There is room to pause, to speak freely,
      and to move at a pace that feels manageable.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section fade" id="about">
  <div class="section-inner soft">
    <h2>Why Moonspace exists</h2>
    <p>
      Many people carry a lot quietly. Stress builds up, thoughts loop,
      emotions get pushed aside because life keeps moving. Reaching out
      for therapy can feel daunting, especially when it seems clinical
      or overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moonspace was created to feel different. It is meant to feel like
      stepping into a calmer room, where you do not need to explain
      everything perfectly or have clear answers. Just showing up is enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moonspace offers individual online counselling sessions for adults.
      Sessions take place through secure video calls and are fully
      confidential.

<!-- APPROACH -->
<section class="section soft fade">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>How therapy is approached</h2>
    <p>
      Therapy at Moonspace is collaborative and reflective. It is not about
      being told what to do or rushing towards solutions. Instead, it is a
      space to notice patterns, understand emotions, and gently build
      clarity over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work focuses on helping you feel more grounded, more aware, and
      more able to respond to life rather than feeling overwhelmed by it.

<!-- INSIGHTS -->

  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>Thoughts and reflections</h2>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>What starting therapy can feel like</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning therapy often comes with uncertainty. Many people worry
        about saying the right things or knowing where to start. In reality,
        therapy is a shared process where curiosity matters more than clarity.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>Anxiety and the pace of modern life</h3>
      <p>
        Constant demands, notifications, and expectations can leave the
        nervous system overwhelmed. Understanding this response is an
        important step towards feeling steadier and more at ease.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>When rest does not feel restful</h3>
      <p>
        Burnout is not just about being tired. This reflection explores how
        emotional exhaustion builds quietly and why rest sometimes needs
        more than time off.
