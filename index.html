  <h1>A quieter place to meet yourself</h1>

  <p>
    Moonspace is an online therapy practice created for people who feel emotionally
    overwhelmed, mentally tired, or quietly disconnected from themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapy here is not rushed. There is no pressure to explain everything perfectly or
    arrive with clarity. This is a space where confusion, uncertainty, and pauses are
    welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moonspace offers calm, reflective online counselling for adults across India — grounded
    in psychological depth, emotional safety, and respect for your pace.

<!-- ================= WHY MOONSPACE ================= -->
<section class="content-section" id="why">
  <h2>Why Moonspace exists</h2>

  <p>
    Many people function well on the outside while carrying anxiety, exhaustion,
    self-doubt, or emotional pain internally. Modern life often leaves little space to slow
    down, reflect, or feel understood without being offered immediate solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moonspace was created in response to this. It exists for people who feel stretched thin,
    emotionally cluttered, or unsure how to articulate what feels off — yet sense that
    something within them needs attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    This practice values slowness over urgency, depth over performance, and understanding
    over fixing. There is no expectation to be productive in therapy. Growth here can be
    subtle, quiet, and deeply personal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name Moonspace reflects this philosophy. Like the moon, which moves through phases
    without rushing or demanding consistency, this space honours emotional cycles, inner
    contradictions, and gradual change.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= THERAPY APPROACH ================= -->
<section class="content-section" id="approach">
  <h2>How therapy is approached</h2>

  <p>
    Therapy at Moonspace is collaborative and relational rather than prescriptive. Sessions
    are shaped by careful listening and attunement, not rigid frameworks or timelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Psychological safety is prioritised before insight. This means respecting emotional
    boundaries, pacing conversations thoughtfully, and remaining sensitive to how
    experiences are held in the body and nervous system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work draws from established psychological frameworks while remaining flexible to
    individual needs. Emphasis is placed on understanding emotional patterns, internal
    narratives, and relational dynamics — not simply managing symptoms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapy here is not about being fixed. It is about developing awareness, self-compassion,
    and agency, so you can move through life with greater clarity and trust in yourself.
  </p>

<!-- ================= EXPERIENCE ================= -->

  <h2>The Moonspace experience</h2>

  <p class="section-intro">
    These gentle experiences are not exercises to perfect. They are invitations to pause,
    notice, and reconnect — even briefly.

<!-- ================= SERVICES ================= -->
<section class="content-section" id="services">
  <h2>Online counselling services</h2>

  <p>
    Moonspace offers individual online counselling sessions for adults across India. Sessions
    are conducted via secure video calls and are fully confidential.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapy may support concerns related to anxiety, chronic stress, burnout, emotional
    regulation, overthinking, identity questions, relational difficulties, and periods of
    transition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sessions are personalised rather than agenda-driven. What is explored emerges from what
    feels most relevant and present for you.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= THERAPIST ================= -->
<section class="content-section" id="therapist">
  <h2>Your therapist</h2>

  <p>
    Moonspace is led by Girisha Kamboj, a psychologist who values depth, nuance, and ethical
    care over quick interventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her work is grounded in empathy, curiosity, and respect for each individual’s lived
    experience. Training and clinical education have emphasised not only psychological
    theory, but also self-reflection, boundaries, and responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Girisha works particularly well with individuals navigating anxiety, emotional
    overwhelm, burnout, identity concerns, and relational patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Above all, she believes therapy should feel human — spacious enough for uncertainty,
    complexity, and slow growth.

        Healing is often subtle — showing up as steadiness rather than relief. This piece
