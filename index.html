    <h1>A quieter place to meet yourself</h1>
    <p>
      Moonspace is an online counselling practice for people who feel mentally
      tired, emotionally overwhelmed, or unsure where to begin. It offers a
      calm and steady space to talk, reflect, and slowly understand what is
      happening within you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therapy here is not rushed. There is room to pause, to speak freely,
      and to move at a pace that feels manageable.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section fade" id="about">
  <div class="section-inner soft">
    <h2>Why Moonspace exists</h2>
    <p>
          Moonspace was created in response to how overwhelming modern life can quietly become. Many people carry
          anxiety, exhaustion, self-doubt, and emotional pain while still functioning, achieving, and appearing “fine”
          on the outside. There is often little room to slow down, reflect, or be met with patience rather than
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moonspace exists to offer that pause.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a space designed for people who feel stretched thin, emotionally cluttered, or disconnected from
          themselves, yet may not know how to articulate it. A space where experiences are explored gently, without
          urgency to fix or label, and without pressure to perform progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Moonspace reflects this intention. Much like the moon, which does not rush or compete with the sun,
          this space honours quieter rhythms. It acknowledges phases, uncertainty, and the parts of us that surface only
          when things are calm enough to be seen. Moonspace exists to support reflection, emotional regulation, and
          deeper self-understanding, at a pace that feels safe and respectful.

    <h2>Online counselling services</h2>
    <p>
      Moonspace offers individual online counselling sessions for adults.
      Sessions take place through secure video calls and are fully
      confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therapy can support you with anxiety, stress, burnout, emotional
      regulation, self-esteem concerns, and periods of transition. Sessions
      are shaped around what feels most relevant to you rather than a fixed
      agenda.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- APPROACH -->
<section class="section soft fade">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>How therapy is approached</h2>
    <p>
          Therapy at Moonspace is approached as a collaborative and relational process, not a prescriptive one. There is
          no rigid agenda imposed on your experiences, and no expectation that healing should look a certain way or
          follow a timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sessions focus on creating psychological safety first. This means paying close attention to emotional
          boundaries, comfort levels, and the nervous system. Conversations unfold at a pace that allows insight without
          overwhelm, and exploration without intrusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The therapeutic work draws from established psychological frameworks while remaining flexible to individual
          needs. Emphasis is placed on understanding patterns, emotional responses, relational dynamics, and internal
          narratives, rather than simply managing symptoms. Reflection, emotional processing, and meaning-making are
          central to the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Importantly, therapy here is not about being “fixed.” It is about developing awareness, compassion, and
          agency, so that clients feel more grounded within themselves and better equipped to navigate their lives with
          clarity and self-trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online sessions are conducted with the same depth, presence, and ethical care as in-person therapy, offering
          continuity, accessibility, and privacy.
        </p>

<!-- THERAPIST -->
<section class="section fade" id="therapist">
  <div class="section-inner soft">
    <h2>Your therapist</h2>
    <p>
          Moonspace is led by Girisha Kamboj, a psychologist who values depth, nuance, and ethical care over quick
          interventions. Her therapeutic approach is rooted in curiosity, empathy, and respect for each individual’s
          lived experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Girisha’s training and clinical education have emphasized not only psychological theory and technique, but
          also self-reflection, boundaries, and the responsibility that comes with holding another person’s inner world.
          This informs a practice that is thoughtful, emotionally attuned, and grounded in professional ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
          She works particularly well with individuals navigating anxiety, emotional overwhelm, identity questions,
          burnout, and relational difficulties. Sessions are shaped by careful listening rather than assumptions,
          allowing clients to feel seen without being reduced to diagnoses or labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, Girisha believes that therapy should feel human. It should allow space for uncertainty, complexity,
          and growth, while maintaining clear structure, confidentiality, and care.

<!-- INSIGHTS -->
<section class="section soft fade" id="insights">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2>Thoughts and reflections</h2>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>What starting therapy can feel like</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning therapy often comes with uncertainty. Many people worry
        about saying the right things or knowing where to start. In reality,
        therapy is a shared process where curiosity matters more than clarity.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>Anxiety and the pace of modern life</h3>
      <p>
        Constant demands, notifications, and expectations can leave the
        nervous system overwhelmed. Understanding this response is an
        important step towards feeling steadier and more at ease.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="insight">
      <h3>When rest does not feel restful</h3>
      <p>
        Burnout is not just about being tired. This reflection explores how
        emotional exhaustion builds quietly and why rest sometimes needs
        more than time off.
